    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Scrambled eggs are a classic breakfast dish made by whisking eggs and
      cooking them slowly in a pan until they're soft, creamy, and slightly
      fluffy. They're a versatile dish that can be customized with various
      ingredients like cheese, herbs, vegetables, or meats, making them a
      popular choice for a quick and satisfying meal.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2-3 eggs</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>Butter or oil for cooking</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Crack the eggs into a bowl and whisk them together with a fork or whisk
        until well combined. Add a pinch of salt and pepper to taste.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat and add a small amount of
        butter or oil to coat the pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the whisked eggs into the skillet and let them cook undisturbed for
        a few seconds until they start to set around the edges.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using a spatula, gently push the cooked edges towards the center of the
        pan, allowing the uncooked eggs to flow to the edges.
      </li>
      <li>
        Continue cooking and gently stirring the eggs until they're mostly set
        but still slightly runny.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the skillet from the heat and let the residual heat finish
        cooking the eggs. They should be soft, creamy, and slightly runny when
        done.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve the scrambled eggs immediately, optionally topped with cheese,
        herbs, or any other desired toppings. Enjoy!
