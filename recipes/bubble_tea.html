    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Bubble tea, also known as boba tea, is a popular Taiwanese drink that
      combines sweet, flavored tea with chewy tapioca pearls. It originated in
      the 1980s and has since become a worldwide phenomenon. The drink typically
      consists of brewed tea, milk or fruit flavors, sweeteners like sugar or
      honey, and the signature tapioca pearls. It's often served cold, sometimes
      blended with ice to create a slushy texture, making it a refreshing and
      indulgent treat.
